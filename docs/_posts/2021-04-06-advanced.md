<!-- AMiGA is covered under the GPL-3 license -->
 

The objective of this "Advanced" tutorial is to showcase for advanced users who are familiar with `Python` how to adopt `AMiGA` code into their own scripts instead of relying on the command-line interface (CLI). If you want to run `AMiGA` the easiest way possible, take a look at an [example pipeline](/amiga/doc/example.html).   

Here, I will introdue functions and classes that can be used in a standalone manner for importing data and meta-data, processing growth curves, and fitting growth curves using Gaussian Process (which is implemented using the `GPy` package).
