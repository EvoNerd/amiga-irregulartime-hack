To fit the curves in your data set, simply run the following command.

```bash
python amiga.py -i /home/outbreaks/erandomii/ER1_PM2-1.txt
```
- `-i` or `--input` argument will point to the location of the file of interest<br/>

<br />

Fitting growth curves takes about 1 minutes per 96-well plate. Users can speed this a bit by thinning the input to the GP regression model with the `--time-step-size` parameter. See [Command Line Interface](/amiga/doc/command-line-interface.html) for more details.

<br />




<br /> 

Here, `AMiGA` fits model growth curves as a Gaussian Process (GPs) and use the predicted OD to estimate growth parameters. In particular, first, `AMiGA` will compute the following metrics for all growth curves:

|Metric|Description|
|:---|:---|
|OD_Baseline|The OD measurement at the first time point|
|OD_Min|The minimum OD measurement at any time points|
|OD_Max|The maximum OD measurement at any time points|
|Fold_Change|defined as the ratio of change in OD of the case (or treatment) growth curve relative to change in OD of the control growth curve|

<br />

Second, `AMiGA` will apply the following transformations to you data:
1. Conversion of time units (e.g. from seconds to hours). Choice of units is defined in `amiga\libs\config.py`.
2. Natural logarithmic transformation (i.e. OD --> ln(OD))
3. Baseline correction: either by subtracting the initial ln(OD) measurement from all subsequent ln(OD) measurements (i.e. normalizes data to the first time point such that growth curves always start at ln(OD)=0 or OD=1), or using a polynomial regression based estimate of ln(OD) at the first time point. The latter option is used by default. To use the former method, set `config['PolyFit']` to False in `amiga\libs\config.py`.

<br />

Finally, using the GP fit, `AMiGA` will estimate the following growth parameters and save them in a tab-separated file with the suffix `_summary.txt`.

|Short Name|Long Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|auc_lin|AUC (lin)|Area Under the curve (in units of OD, and based on user-specified of time)|
|auc_log|AUC (log)|Area Under the curve (in units of log OD, and based on user-specified of time)|
|death_lin|Death (lin)|Total loss of growth (in units of OD)|
|death_log|Death (log)|Total loss of growth in units of log-OD)|
|diauxie|Diauxie|Multi-phasic grwoth (True or False)|
|dr|Death Rate|Maximum specific death rate|
|gr|Growth Rate|Maximum specific growth rate|
|k_lin|Carrying Capacity (lin)|Carrying capacity (in units of OD, assumes that OD starts at 0)|
|k_log|Carrying Capacity (log)|Carrying capacity (in units of log OD, assumes that OD starts at 0)|
|lagC|Lag Time|Time delay needed to enter exponential growth|
|lagP|Adaptation Time|Time delay needed to initiate positive growth|
|t_dr|Time at Max. Death Rate|Time point at which minimum gowth rate (i.e. maximum death rate) is reached|
|t_gr|Time at Max. Growth Rate|Time point at which maximum growth rate is reached|
|t_k|Time at Carrying Capacity|Time point at which carrying capacity is eached|
|td|Doubling time|Doubling Time 

If AMiGA detects multi-phasic growth (e.g. diauxic shift) in any well, it will also characterize the above growth parameters for each unique growth phase. These additional parameters will be saved in a separate tab-separated file with the suffix `_diauxie.txt`.
