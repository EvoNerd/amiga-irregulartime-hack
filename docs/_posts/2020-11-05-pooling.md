AMiGA can model individual growth curves to estimate growth parameters. It can also pool experimental and/or technical replicates to model mean growth behavior and estimate summary statistics for growth parameters, in particular mean, standard deviation, and confidence intervals.

<br/>

To pool replicates, you must pass the necessary meta-data to AMiGA. See [Preparing metadata](/amiga/doc/metadata.html). Here, my meta-data includes columns for `Isolate`, `Substrate`, and `Concentration`. I have two technical replicates for CD2015 grown on Biolog PM1 plates. Because I am pooling by `Isolate`, AMiGA will all replicate growth curves fo the CD2015 isolate on `Substrate` and `Concentration`. There are 96 substrates and 

<br/>

In this example, I have in my working directory (`-i`) multiple data files in the `data` sub-folder. I want to analyze all growth curvse separately without pooling. I also want to normalize the growth parameters to their respective controls. 

```bash
python $amiga/amiga.py \
        -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/ \
        -o "split_normalized_merged" \
        --normalize-parameters
        --merge-summary\
```               

<br/>

Below, I however ask AMiGA to pool replicates based on all unique combinations of `Isolate`and `Substrate`. If I am analyzing the growth of 2 isolates on 96 substrates, I have 192 unique combinations. For each unique condition (Isolate x Substrate), AMiGA will find all replicate samples and model them jointly. 

```bash
python $amiga/amiga.py \
        -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/ \
        -o "pooled_analysis" \
        --pool-by "Isolate,Substrate"
```

<br/>

Below, the `--sample-posterior` arguments asks AMiGA to infer summary statistics for the estimated growth parameters. In the `summary` files, AMiGA will report the mean and standard deviation for each growth parameter, except for `diauxie` and the growth parameters for each phase of diauxic shifts. 

```bash
python $amiga/amiga.py \
        -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/ \
        -o "pooled_analysis" \
        --pool-by "Isolate,Substrate" \
        --sample-posterior 
```

<br/>

If I want to also normalize the growth parameters for pooled replicates, it is a bit tricky but it's doable. Here, I use the `--normalize-by` option which is only available for pooled analysis. I specify that AMiGA should normalize by the negative control wells. In this case, each unique model is specified by an `Isolate` and a `Substrate`. So, AMiGA will normalize the growth of each isolate on all substrates to its growth on the negative control (i.e. no carbon substrate) well. 

```bash
python $amiga/amiga.py \
        -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/ \
        -o "pooled_normalized_merged_by_ribotype" \
        --pool-by "Isolate,Substrate" \
        --normalize-by "Substrate:Negative Control" \
        --sample-posterior  \
```

<br/>

Of course, you can further specify the analysis with additional command line arguments. 

```bash
python $amiga/amiga.py
        -i /Users/firasmidani/experiment/
        -o "pooled_analysis" \
        --pool-by "Isolate,Substrate,PM" \
        --normalize-by "Substrate:Negative Control" \
        --skip-first-n 1 -tss 1 --sample-posterior  \
        --save-gp-data --save-cleaned-data --save-mapping-data \
        --fix-noise --verbose
```
