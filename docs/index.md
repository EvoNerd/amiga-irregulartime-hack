### What is AMiGA?

It is a python-based program for high-throughput analysis of microbial growth data sets that are typically generated by multi-well plate readers. It estimates microbial growth parameters such as exponential growth time, doubling time, lag phase, and carrying capacity. It also estimates microbial death and death rates as well as detects and describes diauxic shifts in growth data. It is especially useful for the rapid analysis of standardized multi-well plates including Biolog Phenotypic Microarray (PM<a></a>) data.

An advantage of AMiGA is its application of a nonparameteric approch for modelling microbial growth data. Many microbial growth curves do not follow standard logistic or sigmoidal shapes. The nonparameteric approach of GP regression can model microbial growth data and estimate growth parameters without assumptions about the shape of their growth curves (Swain et *al.* 2016; Tonner et *al.* 2017<a></a>). AMiGA streamlines the analysis of microbial growth data using GP inference in a user-friendly fashion and makes it accessible to researchers with little or no background in bioinformatics. In order to plot or analyze the data, users simply interact with AMiGA using the command line by pointing to a file of interest. User can pass additional arguments or files or define program-specific parameters for more sophisticated analysis.

### What are the main functions of AMiGA?

- Plot the growth curves for 96-well plates.
- Summarize growth curves with basic metrics such as maximum optical density or fold-change relative to control well\(s<a></a>).
- Infer growth curve kinetic parameters such as growth lag, exponential growth rate, doubling time, death rate, carrying capacity, and area under the curve. Inference can be performed on individual growth curves or pooled replicates. The latter can provide a summary distribution for each growth parameter: mean, standard deviation, and confidence intervals. 
- Detect multiple phases of growth (e.g. diauxic shifts) and infer the growth parameters for each unique growth phase.
- Perform Bayesian hypothesis-driven statistical testing of differences in microbial growth under different experimental conditions.
